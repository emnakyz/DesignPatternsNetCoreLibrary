# DesignPatternsNetCoreLibrary

This project, DesignPatternsNetCoreLibrary, contains short examples of design patterns implemented in .NET Core. These patterns are widely recognized solutions to common problems in software design and are demonstrated in simple, easy-to-understand code samples.

What is a Design Pattern?
A design pattern is a general, repeatable solution to a common problem in software design. Itâ€™s not a finished design but a template that helps solve problems in a flexible and reusable way. By using design patterns, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel, reduce code complexity, and improve readability and maintainability.

Design Pattern Categories
Design patterns are classified into three main categories:

Creational Patterns
These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a way suitable to the situation.

Singleton
Factory Method
Abstract Factory
Builder
Prototype
Structural Patterns
These patterns deal with object composition and structure, ensuring that objects and classes work together in an efficient way.

Adapter
Bridge
Composite
Decorator
Facade
Flyweight
Proxy
Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects, helping to ensure flexible and efficient control flow.

Chain of Responsibility
Command
Interpreter
Iterator
Mediator
Memento
Observer
State
Strategy
Template Method
Visitor
Features of the Project
Simple and easy-to-understand examples of design patterns.
Implemented using .NET Core to demonstrate the power of design patterns in modern software development.
Each design pattern is presented with an example that can be directly integrated into your own projects.
