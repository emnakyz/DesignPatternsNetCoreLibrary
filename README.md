# DesignPatternsNetCoreLibrary (.NET 9.0)

**DesignPatternsNetCoreLibrary** is a project that contains short examples of design patterns implemented using .NET Core. These patterns provide general, repeatable solutions to common software design problems and are demonstrated through simple, easy-to-understand code examples.

## What is a Design Pattern?

A **design pattern** is a general, repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is not a finished design but rather a template for solving a problem that can be customized to suit a particular situation. Design patterns help developers avoid reinventing the wheel, reduce complexity, and improve code readability and maintainability.

## Design Pattern Categories

Design patterns are generally classified into three main categories:

### 1. Creational Patterns
These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation.
- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### 2. Structural Patterns
These patterns deal with object composition and structure, ensuring that objects and classes can work together in an efficient way.
- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Proxy**

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects, ensuring that control flow is flexible and efficient.
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Interpreter**
- **Iterator**
- **Mediator**
- **Memento**
- **Observer**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template Method**
- **Visitor**

## Features of the Project

- Simple and understandable code examples for each design pattern.
- Implemented using **.NET Core** to demonstrate modern software development practices.
- Each pattern is presented with an example that can be easily integrated into your own projects.
- The code is designed to solve common problems faced in software development by using the best practices provided by design patterns.

## Usage

You can use the examples provided in the project in your own applications and customize them according to your needs. Detailed explanations and usage instructions for each pattern are provided within the code comments and documentation.
